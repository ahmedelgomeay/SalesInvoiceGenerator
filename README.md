# SalesInvoiceGenerator

# After Review Update:

1) I rebuilt the project again on Intelliji in order to fix any possible errors avoiding the project to run properly.
2) Added screenshot of the working project after rebuilt.
3) Added screenshot of new code line >> information message "Data Saved Successfully" after saving both csv files.

____________________________________________________________________

The project consists of
1) Big Package: com.salesinvoicesgenerator

- Dialogs: represents the dialogs that appears when pressed on "Create New Invoice Button" or "Create New Line Button".

- JFrame: defines the main JFrame including the JPanels, JButtons, JMenuBar & JMenuItems of the project.

- Main: contains the main class & main method.

- Tables: contains both table classes.


You can run the project either from the Main Class or the SalesInvoicesGenerator JFrame Class.

Thanks for your understanding & appreciate your time.
